# Demo Video Script for Rwanda Smart Farmer Chatbot

**Duration: 5-10 minutes**

---

## üé¨ SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Title slide with project name and your name]**

"Hello! Welcome to my demonstration of the Rwanda Smart Farmer Chatbot. 

In this project, I built an AI-powered agricultural assistant specifically designed to help farmers in Rwanda. The chatbot can answer questions about crops, pests, fertilizers, and farming best practices using state-of-the-art natural language processing."

**[Transition to problem statement]**

---

## üéØ SECTION 2: PROBLEM & MOTIVATION (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Show statistics or images of Rwandan agriculture]**

"Agriculture is the backbone of Rwanda's economy, with over 70% of the population engaged in farming. However, many smallholder farmers lack immediate access to expert agricultural advice. 

This chatbot addresses that gap by providing 24/7 access to agricultural information, helping farmers make informed decisions about their crops."

**[Transition to dataset]**

---

## üìä SECTION 3: DATASET & PREPROCESSING (1-2 minutes)

**[Screen: Notebook - Data loading section]**

"I used the agriculture FAQ dataset from Hugging Face, which contains over [X] question-answer pairs about agricultural practices.

Let me show you the data exploration process..."

**[Show these visuals]:**
- Dataset loading code
- Sample Q&A pairs
- Data distribution charts
- Statistics (question/answer lengths)

**[Screen: Preprocessing section]**

"The preprocessing pipeline includes several important steps:

1. **Text Cleaning**: Removing extra whitespace and normalizing punctuation
2. **Duplicate Removal**: Ensuring data quality
3. **Tokenization**: Using T5's specialized tokenizer
4. **Data Splitting**: 70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing

Here you can see the before and after examples of text cleaning..."

**[Show preprocessing code and examples]**

## ü§ñ SECTION 4: MODEL ARCHITECTURE (2 minutes)

**[Screen: Model loading section]**

"For this project, I chose the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model because:

1. It's specifically designed for text generation tasks
2. It treats all NLP tasks as text-to-text problems
3. It has excellent performance on question-answering

The model takes questions in the format 'question: [user query]' and generates natural language answers."

**[Show model architecture diagram or code]**

"I started with T5-small which has [X] million parameters, making it efficient for training while maintaining good performance.

The training configuration includes:
- Learning rate: 5e-5
- Batch size: 8
- Epochs: 3
- Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay

Let me show you the training process..."

## üî¨ SECTION 5: HYPERPARAMETER TUNING (1-2 minutes)

**[Screen: Experiment results table]**

"To optimize performance, I conducted multiple experiments with different hyperparameters:

1. **Baseline**: Learning rate 5e-5, batch size 8, 3 epochs
2. **Lower LR**: More stable training with 3e-5 learning rate
3. **Larger Batch**: Faster training with batch size 16
4. **More Epochs**: Extended training to 5 epochs
5. **Higher LR**: Faster convergence with 1e-4 learning rate

Here's the comparison table showing the results..."

**[Show comparison graphs]:**
- BLEU scores across experiments
- ROUGE scores comparison
- Performance improvement percentages

"The best configuration achieved [X]% improvement over baseline, with the 'More Epochs' setup showing the strongest results."

---

## üìà SECTION 6: EVALUATION METRICS (1-2 minutes)

**[Screen: Evaluation section]**

"I evaluated the model using multiple metrics to ensure comprehensive assessment:

**BLEU Score**: Measures the overlap between generated and reference answers
- Our model achieved: [X.XX]

**ROUGE Scores**: Evaluates the quality of generated summaries
- ROUGE-1: [X.XX]
- ROUGE-L: [X.XX]

**F1 Score**: Token-level accuracy
- Our score: [X.XX]

These metrics show that our model performs [well/excellently] compared to baseline standards."

**[Show metric distribution graphs]**

"I also conducted qualitative testing with Rwanda-specific queries to ensure practical usability."

## üí¨ SECTION 7: LIVE CHATBOT DEMO (2-3 minutes)

**[Screen: Gradio interface]**

"Now let me demonstrate the chatbot in action. I've deployed it using Gradio, which provides a user-friendly web interface."

**[Show interface features]:**
- Clean, intuitive design
- Example questions
- Chat functionality

"Let me ask some typical questions a Rwandan farmer might have..."

**[Type and demonstrate these questions]:**

1. **"How can I prevent maize stem borer?"**
   - [Show answer]
   - "Notice how the chatbot provides practical, actionable advice..."

2. **"What fertilizer should I use for tomatoes?"**
   - [Show answer]
   - "The response includes specific fertilizer types and application methods..."

3. **"When should I plant beans in Rwanda?"**
   - [Show answer]
   - "The chatbot considers Rwanda's specific planting seasons..."

4. **"How do I treat banana bacterial wilt?"**
   - [Show answer]
   - "Even for diseases, it provides clear treatment steps..."

**[Test out-of-domain query]:**

5. **"What is the capital of France?"**
   - [Show answer]
   - "Notice how the chatbot handles non-agricultural questions..."

"The responses are generated in real-time, and the chatbot maintains conversation history for better context."

## üíª SECTION 8: CODE STRUCTURE (1 minute)

**[Screen: Project structure]**

"Let me quickly walk through the code organization:

The project is structured into clear sections:
- Data preprocessing functions
- Model training pipeline
- Evaluation metrics
- Chatbot interface

All code follows best practices with:
- Clear variable names
- Comprehensive comments
